# pirated-games-p2p-menu-gaming-community-pannel
My p2p gaming pannel helps the piracy community have somewhat of a platform where they can communicate and help eachother. For example they have forrums where they can post patches for games etc or anything they want, they can unlock actual achievements just like they can in steam with a popout and sound and much much more!
